# Run with executable

As a last option, I've also packaged up the server as an executable that you can run on your machine. You have to download the builds from https://github.com/gnomeontherun/oscon-2017-workshop/archive/builds.zip. Inside of the `server` directory are three executables for linux, mac, and windows machines. You'll need to have the configuration values setup for them to run.

This executable is autogenerated and I cannot guarantee it will work on your specific machine, which is why it is the last option I suggest.

To run one, open up the command line and run the correct executable.

### Linux

```bash
/path/to/server/server-linux
```

### Windows

```bash
C:\path\to\server\server-win.exe
```

### MacOS

```bash
/path/to/server/server-macos
```
