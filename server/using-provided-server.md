# Using the provided server

For those who are unable to get a server running on their own machine, you can connect to one that I've provided for you. You won't be able to change the currently streaming term, but you'll be able to view the stream that I'm running for the workshop.

The server details are provided below, and you will only need them in the Angular application.

```javascript
