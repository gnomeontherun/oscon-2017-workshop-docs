# Setting up the Angular app

This guide will get your Angular application bootstrapped and running. We'll add layers of complexity to this app, but the first steps are to generate the project and setup dependencies.

We'll add three primary things.

* Clarity - A UI library similar to Bootstrap or other CSS libraries, but with Angular components.
* AngularFire - The official Angular/Firebase library for connecting to Firebase services.
* NgxCharts - A popular Angular component library that provides a number of D3 charts.

We'll use each of them extensively in building our application, and you'll learn a number of qualities about each library.
