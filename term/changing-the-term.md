# Changing the streaming term

In this chapter, we'll focus on how to change the term used for the Twitter stream from the UI. The server has a simple API for this, and we'll need to call it to start a new stream.

Also, we'll take a look at how to capture voice input instead of having to type the new term, which is a fun additional bonus exercise to see how easy it is to actually get started with voice. This isn't really natural language processing, but gets us started down that path.

If you are not running your own server, this part is not possible for you to fully test. You can still build along, but the API calls will fail since servers are running locally to each machine.
