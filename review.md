# Review

Alright! You made it!

We covered a lot of ground in this workshop, and while there are many important lessons mixed in here are the highlights.

* Realtime data requires planning with specific tools designed to handle data instantly
* Complex data analysis is done in the backend and aggregated values are visualized in the UI
* Firebase is a great realtime database for streaming data, especially when prototyping.
* Angular can easily consume realtime data and continuously and efficiently render the current state
* D3 and NgxCharts are great for displaying charts with an Angular application
* Voice is an important way for users to interact with your application, find ways to start using it

Thanks for joining me for this workshop!
