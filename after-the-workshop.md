# After the workshop

While I encourage you to keep playing around with the project and see what you can do with it, here are a few things you might want to do to clean up afterwards.

* Delete the Twitter app you created. Its just not necessary to maintain if you aren't going to use it again and you can always create another.
* Delete the Firebase project. Likewise, its not necessary to keep and you can create more.
